It's great that you're planning to pursue further education in computer science! Hereâ€™s a tailored advice and plan for your transition from a mechanical engineering background to advanced studies in computer science:

---

### **Step 1: Assess Your Interests and Goals**
- **Focus Areas in Computer Science**: Identify what excites you most (e.g., machine learning, data science, software engineering, systems programming, etc.).
- **End Goal**: Clarify whether you're aiming for a research-driven path (Ph.D.) or a practical industry-oriented one (Master's).

---

### **Step 2: Strengthen Your Foundations**
Since you're an IT beginner, these topics are crucial to master before pursuing a computer science degree:
1. **Programming**:
   - Learn one high-level language well (Python, JavaScript, or Java).
   - Practice data structures and algorithms using platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), or [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).

2. **Mathematics**:
   - Focus on linear algebra, discrete mathematics, probability, and statistics, as these are essential for advanced CS topics.
   - Use resources like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) or [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

3. **Computer Science Basics**:
   - **Operating Systems**: Learn about processes, threads, memory management, etc.
   - **Networking**: Understand protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS.
   - **Databases**: Explore relational databases (SQL) and NoSQL systems.

4. **Web Development** (Full-Stack):
   - Since you're working as a full-stack engineer, gain proficiency in frameworks (e.g., React, Node.js) and backend development (e.g., Express.js, Django).

### **Step 3: Leverage Online Courses**
Take advantage of free or paid online resources to deepen your knowledge:
1. **CS Fundamentals**:
   - [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) (Harvard)
   - [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) (MIT)

2. **Specialized Topics**:
   - Machine Learning: [Coursera: Andrew Ng's Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
   - Software Development: [Udemy: Clean Code Practices](https://www.udemy.com/)

3. **Coding Challenges**:
   - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
   - [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

---

### **Step 4: Prepare for Admission**
1. **Target Schools**:
   - Research universities offering computer science degrees with strong reputations (e.g., Stanford, MIT, ETH Zurich, etc.).

2. **Admission Requirements**:
   - **GRE**: Some schools require GRE scores, so start early preparation.
   - **TOEFL/IELTS**: If studying abroad, ensure you meet language proficiency requirements.

3. **Prerequisite Courses**:
   - Some programs require prior knowledge in areas like algorithms, data structures, or operating systems. Check each program's prerequisites and take online courses if needed.

4. **Statement of Purpose (SOP)**:
   - Highlight your mechanical engineering background and how it complements your transition to computer science.
   - Include your current full-stack engineering experience and future goals.

---

### **Step 5: Develop Research Skills (If Considering Ph.D.)**
1. **Read Papers**:
   - Start reading research papers in your area of interest to familiarize yourself with academic writing and current challenges.

2. **Mini Projects**:
   - Build projects in your field of interest (e.g., creating a machine learning model, a scalable web app, or a networking protocol simulation).

3. **Contribute to Open Source**:
   - Get involved in open-source projects on GitHub to gain experience and demonstrate your initiative.

### **Step 6: Build a 2-Year Plan**
| **Timeline**      | **Activities**                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Months 1-6**     | Focus on mastering programming, data structures, and algorithms.              |
| **Months 7-12**    | Deepen knowledge in CS fundamentals (OS, databases, networking).              |
| **Months 13-18**   | Explore advanced topics (machine learning, cloud computing, etc.).            |
| **Months 19-24**   | Prepare for exams (GRE/TOEFL), write SOPs, and apply to schools.              |
| **Ongoing**        | Work on mini-projects, participate in coding competitions, and stay curious!  |
